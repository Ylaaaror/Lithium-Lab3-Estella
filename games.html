			<p>Genshin Impact is an on-going role-playing game that you can play with your friends. 
			The storyline starts where you and your sibling go on a journey to another world, but suddenly your sibling gets captured. 
			In order to reunite with your sibling, you must do quests and missions where you meet new characters in different regions. 
			You also have a wide selection of characters that you can obtain from wishing in the character banner. </p>
